This repository holds my response to the Quality Assurance Assessment given as part of my application for a role at ShapeShift. The repository is broken up into three sections for the three challenges given.

### Assessment as Presented

Please complete 2 of the following 3 tasks with the testing framework(s) of your choice and make your
solutions available in a Github repo.

Task 1: Write a series of API TESTS for the ShapeShift REST API

Task 3: Write a series of UNIT TESTS for the following ES2015 javascript class and fix any issues
your tests reveal

```javascript
class MyMath {
  // add 2 numbers and return result
  add(a, b) {
    return a - b
  }

  // subtract 2 numbers and return result
  subtract(a, b) {
    return a + b
  }

  // multiply 2 numbers and return result
  multiply(a, b) {
    return a / b
